# Game of life

An implementation of [Conway's Game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) as an [Angular](https://angular.io/) application.
The application is used to test out different JavaScript frameworks. Apart from [Angular](https://angular.io/) I currently use [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for the application state. A next step will be to use [stryker](https://stryker-mutator.io/) for mutation testing.

The application can be tested on [http://gossie.github.io/game-of-life](http://gossie.github.io/game-of-life).
